# CANBusHack

Since 1996 OBD-II standard CAN Buses have been mandatory on all cars and light trucks sold in the United States. This repository contains a work done related to hacking my 2001 Toyota Highlander to not only try and make it more modern, but also to understand how the electronics work in a car and what it takes to automate a car.
